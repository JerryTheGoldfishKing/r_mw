# Reversing Minesweeper

## Wtf

This project is currently on-going. The purpose of this is to create a full compilable source code
of the original windows Minesweeper. 

The artifacts of the reverse engineering process:

- Design document explaining the full design and implementation of MineSweeper
- Full compilable source code of MineSweeper
- Finding bugs 

Most of the process is done using static analysis without using a decompiler. I wanted to read lots of assembly code.

## Wtf again

I just wanted to completly reverse engineer something so.. yea.

## Legal issues?

I don't think someone cares about it.. Anyway I don't know enough about legal issues that this might create,
If someone sees any problem talk with me.
